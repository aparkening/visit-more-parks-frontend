# Visit More Parks

Visit More Parks is an app that suggests nearby U.S. National Parks to events in your Google Calendar. The app also makes it easy to add a park visit to your calendar.

This repository houses the React frontend interacts with the [Rails API](https://github.com/aparkening/visit-more-parks-api). 

**What It Does**
- The user logs in with their Google Calendar account.
- US National Parks are pre-loaded with geocoded coordinates and addresses (using the [NPS.gov Parks API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm) and the [Geocoder Ruby gem](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder)).
- Upcoming calendar events are geocoded and displayed with their nearby parks.
- The user can add visits to any of the parks as calendar events.
- Those new events include park information, such as description, address, and URL.
- All 497 National Parks are browsable.
